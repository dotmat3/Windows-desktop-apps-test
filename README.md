<p align="center">:warning:<i>Made for testing purposes only</i>:warning:</p>

## Purpose
This test was carried out with the sole purpose of verifying the speed and approach with each framework in the development of a desktop app on Windows.
None of these apps represent a final and complete product.

## Goals
The test objectivies are:
- ðŸ§® Realize **ONLY** the UI of a simple calculator
- ðŸ”ž Use zero-dependencies
- ðŸ“š Learn something

## Frameworks
The frameworks that I have selected to analyze are the following:
- [**WinForms (Windows Forms)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/dotnet/framework/winforms/): the oldest of the various technologies to such an extent that today it seems to be no longer used for new projects, but has the advantage of being very easy to use for small applications but the drawback that is totally inadequate for supporting large desktop applications
- [**WPF (Windows Production Foundation)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/dotnet/framework/wpf/): evolution of WinForms to renew the way of creating applications in the desktop environment and it is certainly a very interesting technology that, however, will no longer receive updates except for bug fixes. Despite the great potential for the moment it seems that Microsoft has no intention of bringing new features and prefers to focus on the next technology.
- [**UWP (Universal Windows Platform)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/uwp/get-started/): the newest solution and on which Microsoft seems to focus more, certainly represents a very valid choice for the creation of desktop apps, however it has several limitations including the mandatory use of the Windows Store for publishing and the accessible resources. However, it has the advantage of being able to create an interface also suitable for touch devices and the ability to easily distribute the application to all products in the Microsoft environment (PC, Tablet, Phone, Xbox, IoT, Surface Hub, etc.)
- [**Electron.js**](https://www.electronjs.org/): is a framework that you hate or love, unlike the Microsoft-branded alternatives where we have the ability to program via C# and possibly in Visual Basic or F#, with Electron we could use the same technologies used for web development (HTML, CSS and JS). In addition, it provides us with access to the countless packages usable in Node.js. But on the other hand it has large use of memory and CPU which for very heavy applications could be a problem and slow startup times compared to the "quasi-native" alternatives for Windows.
